# Dion's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

Hi im dion , I think the project is really interesting as it ends up making the life of a developer easier in a certain respect. 

From what I could gather regarding the project from my brief overview is that the entire project is based upon github actions which gather various metrics about the host site/sites and provides various functionalities related to that.

My idea for uptime was initially going to be a dashboard however I noticed it is already present. 

##### Proposal for Upptime VsCode extension

Another way to improve the user experience for upptime would be a vscode extension to provide the data and parameters that upptime would normally present, on a vscode extension. This should also be a relatively quick adaption as the uppptime extension could be a webview (so the exsisting codebase should be reusable from the static page) with the addition of a sidebar for quick notifications regarding the site. 

##### Proposal for Response Time

So I was wondering what would be nice to have if it were my application?
And response time looked interesting.

I was wondering whether it would be possible to look up response time based on various locations(I'm not certain on how that functionality was implemented) but it would be interesting to see whether the response times are affected in certain regions more so than others.

##### Proposal for Load Time

Also another important factor for a production site would be the sites load time as it has a big impact of the users bounce rate.

I believe it would be helpful if upptime also displayed the sites load time.

According to a report by google:
- Pages taking 1 – 3 seconds to load will see the probability of bounce rates increase by 32%
- Pages taking 1 – 5 seconds to load will see a 90% increase in bounce rates.

As mentioned in the registration from github externship,I would be able to be productive for about 20-30hrs a week, as I'm a college student with online lectures(They save me a ton of time, barring weeks with examinations).

As for the code snippet and explanation and things about me, I've already submitted that on my registration answer, so feel free to ping me regarding any questions.
