# Dion's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

(Updated Proposal after the AMA on youtube (Great to put a face to the name!))

Hi im dion , I think the project is really interesting as it ends up making the life of a developer easier in a certain respect. 

From what I could gather regarding the project from my brief overview is that the entire project is based upon github actions which gather various metrics about the host site/sites and provides various functionalities related to that.
 
### Proposal for Upptime VsCode extension

[Proposal for the extension](https://www.notion.so/GitHub-Externship-a25eece46edc4d32acaa46d58fae1b0d)



As mentioned in the registration from github externship,I would be able to be productive for about 20-30hrs a week, as I'm a college student with online lectures(They save me a ton of time, barring weeks with examinations).

As for the code snippet and explanation and things about me, I've already submitted that on my registration answer, so feel free to ping me regarding any questions.
