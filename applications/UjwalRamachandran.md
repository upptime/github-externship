## Ujwal's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

Hello everyone! My name is Ujwal, and I want to apply to this externship because I want to develop my current skills, acquire new skills and experience the challenges the real world industry faces and how people come together to form innovative solutions for those challenges. 
I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Springboot and have also worked on a few other platforms. 

#### College Achievements :
1. Finalist in Manipal Hackathon.
2. Qualified for International Astronomy Astrophysics Competition (IAAC) final round with special honours.
3. Research and Technical Head @ Lakshya - The Agri Club, Manipal. 

#### Ideas for Koj :
1. A new feature that allows the customer to scan furniture and add that to the 3D model created by Koj. This feature is optional but I believe it gives the customer a little more "freedom" in designing the room.
   
   The program can suggest if selected furniture complements the room or not (rating).
   
2. A 3D view of the room (Like Google street view).

I am a fast learner, and I believe that I can contribute a lot to the team. I am sure to commit 15-20 hours per week and 1 hour per day during my end-semester exams(End of June).
