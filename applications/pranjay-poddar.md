# Pranjay's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

Hello, My name is Pranjay and I want to apply to this externship because Iam passionate about front-end web development and want to enhance my skill by working on this project. I want to gain experience in open source development and this project would be the best opportunity for me to start my open source journey.Along with my ongoing college academics, I can give up to 10 to 12 hours per week. One feature that I would like to add in Uptime is the chatbot which could provide some interactive information about the website that the user is in search off. Iam a quick learner and a hard-working developer and I have worked on various front-end personal projects, Iam  looking forward to support my family in this pandemic situation and getting this externship would be an extremely fruitful opportunity for me.
