# Upptime GitHub Externship

## About this externship

**[upptime/upptime](https://github.com/upptime/upptime)** is an open-source uptime monitor and status page, powered by GitHub Actions, Issues, and Pages. It uses Node.js and is written in TypeScript by your friends at [Koj](https://github.com/koj-co).

In partnership with GitHub, we're helping launch the Upptime Externship, where students can get paid to work on open-source software. More about the [GitHub Externship](https://github-externships.github.io/externship/) program is available on their website:

> The GitHub Externship is a 90-day fellowship program for third or pre-final year students of GitHub Campus Partner schools. The GitHub Externship program is about learning, preparing students to be market ready, strengthening industry-academia relation, and giving practical experience to students. This program aims to provide innovative solutions to the partner organizations on their existing challenges as well as helping organization identify real talent that can be employed by the organizations at later stages.

Third-year students that are part of Higher-Ed institutions in India that have signed up for the GitHub Campus Program are eligible for this program.

### How it works

#### Hands-on experience

Get the opportunity to work on a real-world problem -- Uptime monitoring is a simple concept, but is extremely important for businesses. The average cost of downtime is $5,600 per minute, according to a 2014 study by Gartner ([How much does an hour of downtime cost?](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/1192213/q-a-how-much-does-an-hour-of-downtime-cost-)), and it's significantly higher for larger websites. When Amazon.com was down for ~63 minutes on Prime Day 2018, its estimated cost was nearly $100 million ([Amazon Outage: Estimated $99 Million Lost](https://techmonitor.ai/techonology/cloud/amazon-outage-lost-sales)). Uptime monitoring solves this problem by automatically checking your website from time to time, and informing you of outages.

Upptime is a large project with over 7,000 stars on GitHub, and over 1,000 users and organizations using it. We still have several feature requests ([see our top feature requests](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/discussions/categories/ideas?discussions_q=is%3Aunanswered+sort%3Atop+category%3AIdeas)) that people would love to see, and a few bugs to squash. At the Upptime GitHub Externship, you get to work on these and more, and get a stipend of $200 per month for it.

#### Mentorship

One of the key rewards of a GitHub Externship is that you get to learn best practices under the guidance of industry leaders. Upptime is built by [Anand Chowdhary](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary), the co-founder and CTO of Koj, and an avid open-source contributor. He is a [GitHub Star](https://stars.github.com/profiles/anandchowdhary/) (the first ever from the Netherlands), Forbes 30 Under 30 alum, and one of the most innovative entrepreneurs in the Netherlands, according to [Het Financieele Dagblad](https://www.utoday.nl/news/64978/nominatie-voor-ondernemende-student-anand-chowdhary). As part of the Upptime GitHub Externship, mentees will learn about the project, programming best-practices, and spend one-on-one time with Anand.
